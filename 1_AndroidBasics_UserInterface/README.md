# Android Basics -- User Interface

The Android apps in this folder are simple 1-screen cards with no interaction functionality. 

## Demo_BirthdayCard

This is a birthday card app developed step-by-step in the Audacity course.

## SpringIsComing1 and SpringIsComing2

These 2 apps were developed as an exercise at the end of the course. They are simply like postcards that you could send to a friend. The difference is simply on the background image.

## LisbonExplorers

This app is a list of future events for a group invented just for this app. It could be used for example by a Meetup group to announce the future events to its members.
